Algorithm
  1.Start 
  2.input number of white balls
  3.input number of black balls
  4.set row is = to 1
  5.set height is = to 1 
  6.condition:
	•if row is odd and white >or = t row
	•subtract row from white 
	•set height = to row
	•else if row is even and black >or  to row
	•subtract row from black set height = row
	•else
	•stop the loop
	•increase row by 1
  7.output the height of triangle
  8.end
